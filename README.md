Building
========
This code uses Gradle to automate the compiling and building of the projects. 

* You can install Gradle by following the guide provided in http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/installation.html.  Usually you only have to download and extract the Gradle distribution from http://www.gradle.org/downloads  and add the bin directory of the extracted Gradle distribution to to your path variable.
* All the sample codes can be built by issuing the "gradle build" command in the main folder of the code repository.
* Project files for Eclipse IDE can be generated by running the run "gradle eclipse" command in the main folder of the code repository.
